	* small code changes

2009-09-24
	* DVI resolution is now checked during PS to PDF conversion and a warning
	message is written to stderr if it is >1200dpi. Large dpi values may
	lead to distorted animations when using Ghostscript ps2pdf.

2009-08-31
	* small code and documentation adjustments

2009-08-17
	* small code changes

2009-07-23

	timeline file
	* improved documentation of the timeline option
	* new animateinline example (Lorenz Attractor) 
	* Fix: animfp.sty: trailing zeros are now removed from the fractional part
	of the result of the addition of two reals

2009-06-08

	frame rate arguments in timeline files

2009-05-07
	* minor changes/additions in the documentation

2009-01-26
	* minor code refinements

2008-10-06
	* Fix: sometimes, when used with Powerdot document class, parts
	of embedded graphics were missing

2008-08-28
	* Fix: package `calc' like length specifications didn't work with resizing
	options

2008-08-26
	* \@anim@scale rewritten
	* New: length commands \width, \height, \depth and \totalheight for use
	with the resizing options

2008-08-20
	* New: multipage PDF support for XeTeX output driver
	* Change: some exotic graphics formats that depend on QuickTime removed
	from search list for XeTeX output driver

	* New: start of maintaining a ChangeLog file
	* Fix: wrong calculation of dimension variables in \multiframe command
	* Change: stepped animations (using `step' option) don't loop any longer
	by default if `controls' option is set; better \multiframe diagnostics of
	wrong user input

2008-07-14
	* New: \multiframe command for building loops around parameterized
	pictures
