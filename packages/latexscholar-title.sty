% The 'titlesec' package is fabulous! Changing the \chapter and friends is a nightmare. That
% package makes the job easy, piece of cake actually!
%
% noindentafter: Do not indent the first paragraph after a title definition
% rigidchapters: Set a fixed space for chapters
% nobottontitles*: Do not allow a title hanging at the botton (like a widow line)
% largestsep: Uses the largest space between two following titles.
% clearempty: Do not show the page number in an empty page (pretty common in doubleepage docs).
\RequirePackage[pagestyles,noindentafter,rigidchapters,largestsep]{titlesec}

% Add a dot after the section/subsection/etc counters.
\titlelabel{\thetitle.\quad}

\titlespacing{\section}{0pt}{1.2em}{.8em}[0pt]
