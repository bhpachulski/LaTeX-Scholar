% TeX’s first attempt at breaking lines is performed without even trying
% hyphenation: TeX sets its “tolerance” of line breaking oddities to the
% internal value \pretolerance, and sees what happens. If it can’t get an
% acceptable break, TeX adds the hyphenation points allowed by the current
% patterns, and tries again using the internal \tolerance value. If this pass
% also fails, and the internal \emergencystretch value is positive, TeX will
% try a pass that allows \emergencystretch worth of extra stretchability to
% the spaces in each line.
%
% The choice of method has time implications — each of the passes takes time,
% so adding a pass (by changing \emergencystretch) is less desirable than
% suppressing one (by changing \pretolerance). However, it’s unusual nowadays
% to find a computer that’s slow enough that the extra passes are really
% troublesome.
% The value of \emergencystretch is added to the assumed stretchability of each
% line of a paragraph, in a further run of the paragraph formatter in case that
% the paragraph can’t be made to look right any other way. (The extra scan
% happens if \emergencystretch>0pt — if it’s zero or negative, no gain could be
% had from rerunning the paragraph setter.)
%
% More subtle (but more tricky to manage) are the microtypographic extensions
% provided by PDFTeX. There are two extensions, margin kerning and font
% expansion; margin kerning only affects the visual effect of the typeset page,
% and has little effect on the ability of the paragraph setter to “get things
% right”. Font expansion works like a subtler version of the trick that
% \emergencystretch plays: PDFTeX ‘knows’ that your current font may be
% stretched (or shrunk) to a certain extent, and will do that “on the fly” to
% optimise the setting of a paragraph.
