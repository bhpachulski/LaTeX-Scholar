In addition we suggest that new developers prior to cooperate with high between ness centrality or degree centrality and then closeness centrality, discuss that centrality measures can use to guide the preferential collaboration of OSS community.},

abstract={Presents an initial set of findings from an empirical study of social processes, technical system configurations, organisational contexts and interrelationships that give rise to open software. The focus is directed at understanding the requirements for open software development efforts, and how the development of these requirements differs from those traditional to software engineering and requirements engineering. Four open software development communities are described, examined and compared to help discover what these differences may be. Eight kinds of software informalisms are found to play a critical role in the elicitation, analysis, specification, validation and management of requirements for developing open software systems. Subsequently, understanding the roles these software informalisms take in a new formulation of the requirements development process for open source software is the focus of the study. This focus enables the consideration of a reformulation of the requirements engineering process and its associated artefacts, or (in)formalisms, to better account for the requirements for developing open source software systems},

  crossref = {proceedings:fse:2011},
  abstract = {Past research established that individuals joining an Open Source community typically follow a socialization process called "the onion model": newcomers join a project by first contributing at the periphery through mailing list discussions and bug trackers and as they develop skill and reputation within the community they advance to central roles of contributing code and making design decisions. However, the modern Open Source landscape has fewer projects that operate independently and many projects under the umbrella of software ecosystems that bring together projects with common underlying components, technology, and social norms. Participants in such an ecosystems may be able to utilize a significant amount of transferrable knowledge when moving between projects in the ecosystem and, thereby, skip steps in the onion model. In this paper, we examine whether the onion model of joining and progressing in a standalone Open Source project still holds true in large project ecosystems and how the model might change in such settings.},

title={Understanding a developer social network and its evolution},
year={2011},
pages={323-332},
abstract={With the growing number of large scale software projects, software development and maintenance demands the participation of larger groups. Having a thorough understanding of the group of developers is critical for improving development and maintenance quality and reducing cost. In contrast to most commercial software endeavors, developers in open source software (OSS) projects enjoy more freedom to organize and contribute to a project in their own working style. Their interactions through various means in the project generate a latent developer social network (DSN). We have observed that developers and their relationships in these DSNs change continually under the influence of differences in the set of active developers and their changing activities. Revealing and understanding the structure and evolution of these social networks as well as their similarities and differences from other more general social networks (GSNs) is of value to our software engineering community, as it allows us to begin building an understanding of how well the findings from other fields based on GSNs apply to DSN. In this paper, we compare DSNs with popular GSNs such as Facebook, Twitter, Cyworld (a large social network in South Korea), and the Amazon recommendation network. We found, for instance, that while most social networks exhibit power law degree distributions, our DSNs do not. In addition, we also examine how DSNs evolve over time, highlighting how events within a project (such as a release of new software or the departure of prominent developers) impact the makeup of the DSNs, and observe the evolution of topological properties such as modularity and the paths of communities within these networks.},

abstract={Due to their characteristics and claimed advantages, several researchers have been investigating free and open-source projects. Different aspects are being studied: for instance, what motivates developers to join FLOSS projects, the tools, processes and practices used in FLOSS projects, the evolution of FLOSS communities among other things. Researchers have studied collaboration and coordination of open source software developers using an approach known as social network analysis and have gained important insights about these projects. Most researchers, however, have not focused on the integrated study of these networks and, accordingly, in their interrelationships. This paper describes an approach and tool to combine multiple social networks to study the evolution of open-source projects. Our tool, named Sargas, allows comparison and visualization of different social networks at the same time. Initial results of our analysis can be used to extend the "onion-model" of open source participation.},

Executives spend millions on new organizational designs, cultural initiatives, and technologies to promote the sharing of knowledge and expertise across functional, hierarchical, and divisional lines. Yet these efforts have achieved 	disappointing results. <P>Rob Cross and Andrew Parker argue that's 	because most managers have little understanding of how their employees actually interact to get work done. In fact, formal "org charts" fail to reveal the often hidden social networks that truly drive--or hinder--an organization's performance. In this eye-opening book, Cross and Parker show managers how to find, assess, and support the networks most crucial to competitive success. <P>Based on their in-depth study of more than sixty informal networks within organizations around the world, Cross and Parker show how managers can implement a wide range of specific and inexpensive actions-from bridging strategically important disconnects in a network to eliminating information "bottlenecks" to recognizing key connectors-that will enhance the powerful impact networks can have on performan ce and innovation.}},

title={Predicting the severity of a reported bug},
year={2010},
pages={1-10},
abstract={The severity of a reported bug is a critical factor in deciding how soon it needs to be fixed. Unfortunately, while clear guidelines exist on how to assign the severity of a bug, it remains an inherent manual process left to the person reporting the bug. In this paper we investigate whether we can accurately predict the severity of a reported bug by analyzing its textual description using text mining algorithms. Based on three cases drawn from the open-source community (Mozilla, Eclipse and GNOME), we conclude that given a training set of sufficient size (approximately 500 reports per severity), it is possible to predict the severity with a reasonable accuracy (both precision and recall vary between 0.65-0.75 with Mozilla and Eclipse; 0.70-0.85 in the case of GNOME).},

abstract={This paper is the result of reviewing all papers published in the proceedings of the former International Workshop on Mining Software Repositories (MSR) (2004-2006) and now Working Conference on MSR (2007-2009). We have analyzed the papers that contained any experimental analysis of software projects for their potentiality of being replicated. In this regard, three main issues have been addressed: i) the public availability of the data used as case study, ii) the public availability of the processed dataset used by researchers and iii) the public availability of the tools and scripts. A total number of 171 papers have been analyzed from the six workshops/working conferences up to date. Results show that MSR authors use in general publicly available data sources, mainly from free software repositories, but that the amount of publicly available processed datasets is very low. Regarding tools and scripts, for a majority of papers we have not been able to find any tool, even for papers where the authors explicitly state that they have built one. Lessons learned from the experience of reviewing the whole MSR literature and some potential solutions to lower the barriers of replicability are finally presented and discussed.},

abstract={A significant number of Free Software projects has been widely used and considered successful. However, there is an even larger number of them that cannot overcome the initial step towards building an active community of users and developers. In this study, we investigated whether there are relationships between source code metrics and attractiveness, i.e., the ability of a project to attract users and developers. To verify these relationships, we analyzed 6,773 Free Software projects from the SourceForge.net repository. The results indicated that attractiveness is indeed correlated to some source code metrics. This suggests that measurable attributes of the project source code somehow affect the decision to contribute and adopt a Free Software project. The findings described in this study show that it is relevant for project leaders to monitor source code quality, most specifically a few objective metrics, since these can have a positive influence in their chances of forming a community of contributors and users around the software, enabling further enhancement in its quality.},

year={2010},
pages={1-10},
abstract={In no science or engineering discipline does it make sense to speak of isolated experiments. The results of a single experiment cannot be viewed as representative of the underlying reality. The concept of experiment is closely related to replication. Experiment replication is the repetition of an experiment to double-check its results. Multiple replications of an experiment increase the credibility of its results. Software engineering has tried its hand at the identical repetition of experiments in the way of the natural sciences (physics, chemistry, etc.). After numerous attempts over the years, excepting experiments repeated by the same researchers at the same site, no exact replications have yet been achieved. One key reason for this is the complexity of the software development setting. This complexity prevents the many experimental conditions from being reproduced identically. This paper reports research into whether non-exact replications can be of any use. We propose a process that allows researchers to generate new knowledge when running non-exact replications. To illustrate the advantages of the proposed process, two different replications of an experiment are shown.},

abstract={Open Source Software (OSS) mailing lists are used by developers to discuss software engineering tasks performed in the project. In the last years, researchers have been conducting mailing lists linguistic analyses for understanding the intricacies of OSS development. An unpublished approach for that is to use NeuroLinguistic Theory (NT). NT postulates the use of a Preferred Representational cognitive System (PRS) in specific contexts. This means that different resources and cognitive channels are used by developers in order to understand software, but what types of representational systems are the preferred by software engineers? This paper introduces a psychometrically-based neuro-linguistic analysis tool to classify developers, and presents early results of an experiment to assess the PRS of four top developers against a baseline of the Apache server mailing list.},
